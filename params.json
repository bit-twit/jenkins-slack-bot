{"name":"Jenkins-slack-bot","tagline":"Talk to Jenkins via SlackBot","body":"### Introduction\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this project is to provide a smart bot, which enables the direct communication between [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/) and [Slack Channel](https://slack.com/). Users can interact with Jenkins and control various features of jobs by directly sending commands within a Slack Channel.\r\n\r\n### Implementations\r\n\r\nThe project is consist of two independent Java implementations.\r\n\r\n- Jenkins Plugin\r\n    \r\n    The bot is running inside Jenkins as a plugin, which is built on top of [Slack plugin for Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/slack-plugin) and [Instant Messaging Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Instant+Messaging+Plugin). The manager of Jenkins server must install the plugin to activate the bot.\r\n\r\n- Remote SlackBot\r\n    \r\n    The bot can run independently of both Jenkins and Slack. The interaction of Jenkins is implemented via [Remote Access API](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Remote+access+API). **--- Under Construction ---**\r\n\r\n### Supported Commands","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
