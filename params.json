{"name":"Jenkins-slack-bot","tagline":"Talk to Jenkins via SlackBot","body":"### Introduction\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this project is to provide a smart bot, which enables the direct communication between [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/) and [Slack Channel](https://slack.com/). Users can interact with Jenkins and control various features of jobs by directly sending commands within a Slack Channel.\r\n\r\n### Implementations\r\n\r\nThe project is consist of two independent Java implementations.\r\n\r\n- Jenkins Plugin\r\n    \r\n    The bot is running inside Jenkins as a plugin, which is built on top of [Slack plugin for Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/slack-plugin) and [Instant Messaging Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Instant+Messaging+Plugin). The manager of Jenkins server must install the plugin to activate the bot.\r\n\r\n- Remote SlackBot\r\n    \r\n    The bot can run independently of both Jenkins and Slack. The interaction of Jenkins is implemented via [Remote Access API](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Remote+access+API). **--- Under Construction ---**\r\n\r\n### Usage & Demo\r\n\r\n- Jenkins Plugin\r\n    1. Install the slack plugin inside Jenkins. Please contact the Jenkins server managers for help.\r\n    2. Create a [Programming Slackbot](https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202026038-Slackbot-your-assistant-notepad-programmable-bot) and record the global unique token.\r\n    3. Go to \"Mange Jenkins\" -> \"Configure System\", find the \"Global Slack Bot Setting\" section.\r\n        \r\n        ![Jenkins Global Setting](images/jenkins-global-setting.png)\r\n\r\n    4. Type in SlackBot token provided by Slack. \r\n    5. If the Jenkins is protected, a valid Jenkins user Id must be provided, otherwise most commnands won't work. You can also use this to restrict which commands can be executed via the bot, by removing the respective permissions for this user.\r\n    6. Save\r\n    7. Go to your Slack channel and try \"!jenkins botsnack apple\"\r\n        \r\n        ![Botsnack Commands](images/botsnack-command.png)\r\n\r\n    8. \"!jenkins help\" command will always provide the full list of available commands. \r\n\r\n        ![Help Commands](images/help-command.png)\r\n\r\n- Remote SlackBot\r\n    \r\n    To be Finished\r\n\r\n\r\n### Supported Commands\r\n####Schedule a job build, with standard, custom or no quiet period\r\n    build <job> [now|<delay>[s|m|h]] [<parameterkey>=<value>]* \r\n    schedule <job> [now|<delay>[s|m|h]] [<parameterkey>=<value>]* \r\n####Specify which job to abort\r\n    abort <job>\r\n####Adds a description to a build\r\n    comment <job> <build-#> <comment>\r\n\r\n---\r\n####List jobs which are currently in progress\r\n    cb \r\n    currentlyBuilding \r\n####Show the health of a specific job, jobs in a view or all jobs\r\n    h [<job>|-v <view>]\r\n    health [<job>|-v <view>]\r\n####Show the status of a specific job, jobs in a view or all jobs\r\n    jobs [<job>|-v <view>] \r\n    s [<job>|-v <view>]\r\n    status [<job>|-v <view>]\r\n####Show the state of the build queue\r\n    q\r\n    queue\r\n####Show the test results of a specific job, jobs in a view or all jobs\r\n    testresult [<job>|-v <view>]\r\n####Prints information about a Jenkins user\r\n    userstat <username> \r\n\r\n---\r\n####Defines a new alias, deletes one or lists all existing aliases\r\n    alias [<alias> [<command>]] \r\n####om nom nom\r\n    botsnack [<snack>]","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
