{"name":"Jenkins-slack-bot","tagline":"Talk to Jenkins via SlackBot","body":"### Introduction\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this project is to provide a smart bot, which enables the direct communication between [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/) and [Slack Channel](https://slack.com/). Users can interact with Jenkins and control various features of jobs by directly sending commands within a Slack Channel.\r\n\r\n### Implementations\r\n\r\nThe project is consist of two independent Java implementations.\r\n\r\n- Jenkins Plugin\r\n    \r\n    The bot is running inside Jenkins as a plugin, which is built on top of [Slack plugin for Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/slack-plugin) and [Instant Messaging Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Instant+Messaging+Plugin). The manager of Jenkins server must install the plugin to activate the bot.\r\n\r\n- Remote SlackBot\r\n    \r\n    The bot can run independently of both Jenkins and Slack. The interaction of Jenkins is implemented via [Remote Access API](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Remote+access+API). **--- Under Construction ---**\r\n\r\n### Supported Commands\r\n####Schedule a job build, with standard, custom or no quiet period\r\n    build <job> [now|<delay>[s|m|h]] [<parameterkey>=<value>]* \r\n    schedule <job> [now|<delay>[s|m|h]] [<parameterkey>=<value>]* \r\n####Specify which job to abort\r\n    abort <job>\r\n####Adds a description to a build\r\n    comment <job> <build-#> <comment>\r\n\r\n---\r\n####List jobs which are currently in progress\r\n    cb \r\n    currentlyBuilding \r\n####Show the health of a specific job, jobs in a view or all jobs\r\n    h [<job>|-v <view>]\r\n    health [<job>|-v <view>]\r\n####Show the status of a specific job, jobs in a view or all jobs\r\n    jobs [<job>|-v <view>] \r\n    s [<job>|-v <view>]\r\n    status [<job>|-v <view>]\r\n####Show the state of the build queue\r\n    q\r\n    queue\r\n####Show the test results of a specific job, jobs in a view or all jobs\r\n    testresult [<job>|-v <view>]\r\n####Prints information about a Jenkins user\r\n    userstat <username> \r\n\r\n---\r\n####Defines a new alias, deletes one or lists all existing aliases\r\n    alias [<alias> [<command>]] \r\n####om nom nom\r\n    botsnack [<snack>]","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
